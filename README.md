# Slabo

Slabo is a group project management application, developed by Kunal Kataria, Johnson Hui, Eddie Lou, and Justin Lu.

Our application has various features, including a chat room among group members, a to-do list, polls, event calendar, and file sharing.

It uses Aurelien Ribonâ€™s Sliding-Layout library for the sliding panels that make up the main GUI.

Slabo is written in Java, and uses a MySQL database to store the data.
